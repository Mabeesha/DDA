# DDA
Dynamic difficulty adjustment is a hot research topic in gaming industry. After arrival of multiplayer games, players interest in single player games dropped due to the lack of competitiveness in single player games. As a solution for that, these DDA methods emerged for different game genres. Our team build a DDA system for FPS games (First person shooter games) which works by detecting the players strategy. In simple terms, we simply adjust selected game parameters for different play styles. In order to test it we built a simple FPS game along side with a machine learning model which can identify the players strategy and a fuzzy based inference model to change the game parameters.
